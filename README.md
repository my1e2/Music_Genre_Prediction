Write a Medium post describing how you applied supervised learning to extract insights from a dataset. Using methods from module 6, you should construct a dataset of interest, identify the type of supervision problem (i.e., classification or regression), describe (and justify) your selection of the supervised learning model, and explain the supervised labels/scores you will use (i.e., where they come from and what they mean). After training and applying your model to your dataset, explain how you determined whether the model was performing well or not. Then, select 5 samples that your learning model got wrong, and discuss why you think these samples were incorrectly labeled/scored. 

Your post should include the following:

Describe a question you think can be answered using data, what specific stakeholder is asking this question, and what decision(s) the answer to this question will inform.

Describe the data that could answer this question, what fields it contains, how ground-truth labels were generated, and why it is relevant to your question.

Explain how you collected some subset of this data (e.g., libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, tweepy, praw, etc. or from data archive).

Discuss and justify whether you are using a classification or regression model for this analysis; include a description of the feature you are predicting (e.g., is it continuous, binary, categorical, numeric, etc).

Define what features you are using for your supervised model.

After applying your trained model, identify 5 samples that your learning model got wrong, and discuss why you think these samples were incorrectly labeled/scored.

Provide an answer to your question, explaining your analysis of the data you collected, and how it answers that question.

Include figures or tables summarizing your findings. 

Discuss the limitations of your analysis. What’s missing? How might it be biased?
